   - (step name {:screenshots? true} body...) — with options map (compile-time literal)

   Supported options:
     :screenshots?  — take before/after screenshots (requires *page*)
     :http?         — attach HTTP exchange markdown for APIResponse / browser Response

   Steps can nest arbitrarily:

   All step calls are no-ops when not running under the Allure reporter.

   Creates a parent step with two nested child steps:

   - \"After: <name>\"  — screenshot captured after the action

   Requires `*page*` to be bound (typically done by the reporter's
   `with-traced-page` or test fixtures).

   When Playwright tracing is active (`*trace-path*` is bound), the
   explicit screenshots are skipped — the trace already captures visual
   state on every action, so the screenshots would only add noise to
   the trace timeline without providing additional value.

   The step hierarchy in the Allure report (without tracing):

     ✓ Login to application
       ├── Before: Login to application (screenshot)
       ├── ... (your actions)

       (locator/fill username-input \"admin\")
       (locator/fill password-input \"secret\")

(defmacro api-step
  "Execute an API step with automatic request/response logging.

   APIResponse or browser Response, automatically captures request details
   (method, URL, headers, body) and attaches a Markdown document showing the
   full HTTP exchange with request/response headers, bodies, and a cURL command.

   Supports two types of responses:
     - `com.microsoft.playwright.APIResponse` — from API testing (api-get, api-post, etc.)
     - `com.microsoft.playwright.Response` — from browser network (page/wait-for-response, etc.)

   For APIResponse, uses `core/*request-capture*` to capture request metadata
   from `execute-request` during body execution — no manual configuration needed.
   For browser Response, extracts request details from the Response's Request object.

   Usage:

     ;; API testing
     (allure/api-step \"Create user\"
       (core/api-post ctx \"/users\"
         {:data \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"Alice\\\"}\"
          :headers {\"Content-Type\" \"application/json\"}}))

     ;; Browser network
     (allure/api-step \"Navigate to page\"
       (page/wait-for-response pg \"**/api/data\"
         #(page/navigate pg \"https://example.com\")))

   Works with any expression — only attaches metadata when the result
   is an APIResponse or browser Response instance. No-op when not running
   under the Allure reporter."
